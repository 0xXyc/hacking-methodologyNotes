# ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Use-After-Free

## Introduction

A _**use-after-free**_**&#x20;(UAF)** is a class of vulnerabilities that <mark style="color:yellow;">occurs when a program tries to dereference a pointer that points to a freed chunk in the heap</mark>.&#x20;

The explicit attempt to access that chunk that has been previously freed is called a (UAF) bug.

## Consequences

* Program crash
* Printing unexpected values or data
* Code execution

## Steps for Exploitation

1. `free()` data
2. `malloc()` data
3. Add data
4. Cause a dangling pointer to call your code // execute your shellcode

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (5) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption><p><code>p</code> still points to chunk A which now contains the address for function <code>f2</code></p></figcaption></figure>

In the depiction above, `p` still points to chunk `A` and when it is accessed again, `f2` will be executed.

This ultimately leverages a particular behavior in `ptmalloc()`'s allocator where `malloc()` will return the address of the first chunk that matches a memory requirement.

We can see this behavior below in the following snippet:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

int main()
{
	fprintf(stderr, "This file doesn't demonstrate an attack, but shows the nature of glibc's allocator.\n");
	fprintf(stderr, "glibc uses a first-fit algorithm to select a free chunk.\n");
	fprintf(stderr, "If a chunk is free and large enough, malloc will select this chunk.\n");
	fprintf(stderr, "This can be exploited in a use-after-free situation.\n");

	fprintf(stderr, "Allocating 2 buffers. They can be large, don't have to be fastbin.\n");
	char* a = malloc(0x512);
	char* b = malloc(0x256);
	char* c;

	fprintf(stderr, "1st malloc(0x512): %p\n", a);
	fprintf(stderr, "2nd malloc(0x256): %p\n", b);
	fprintf(stderr, "we could continue mallocing here...\n");
	fprintf(stderr, "now let's put a string at a that we can read later \"this is A!\"\n");
	strcpy(a, "this is A!");
	fprintf(stderr, "first allocation %p points to %s\n", a, a);

	fprintf(stderr, "Freeing the first one...\n");
	free(a);

	fprintf(stderr, "We don't need to free anything again. As long as we allocate smaller than 0x512, it will end up at %p\n", a);

	fprintf(stderr, "So, let's allocate 0x500 bytes\n");
	c = malloc(0x500);
	fprintf(stderr, "3rd malloc(0x500): %p\n", c);
	fprintf(stderr, "And put a different string here, \"this is C!\"\n");
	strcpy(c, "this is C!");
	fprintf(stderr, "3rd allocation %p points to %s\n", c, c);
	fprintf(stderr, "first allocation %p points to %s\n", a, a);
	fprintf(stderr, "If we reuse the first allocation, it now holds the data from the third allocation.\n");
}
```

## Popping a Shell w/ a UAF Bug

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

struct unicorn_counter { int num; };

int main() {
    struct unicorn_counter* p_unicorn_counter;
    int* run_calc = malloc(sizeof(int));
    *run_calc = 0;
    free(run_calc);
    p_unicorn_counter = malloc(sizeof(struct unicorn_counter));
    p_unicorn_counter->num = 42;
    if (*run_calc) execl("/bin/sh", 0);
}
```

This appears as if it should never work, right?

Well, when `*run_calc` is set to `0`, `p_unicorn_counter` will point to the same chunk as `run_calc` because they both have similar memory requirements.&#x20;

Therefore, once `run_calc` is accessed again, it will contain a different value and allow for the call to `execl()` and execute `"/bin/sh"`.
