# 🌊 Buffer Overflow Deep Dive

## Introduction to: Buffer Overflows!

:wave: Now welcoming... a special guest, our victim program!!!! Be sure to give it an overwhelming amount of love and support, just be sure not to overdo it or unexpected results may follow suit :stuck\_out\_tongue\_closed\_eyes:

**`simple-bof.c`:**

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main() {

        puts("Hello, welcome to the deep dive into a super simple, textbook stack-based buffer overflow!!\n");
        puts("Let me first create a super SECURE buffer for us to store our user input ;)\n");
        
        char buf[50];
        puts("[+] Okay, our secure buffer has been created\n");
        puts("What could possibly go wrong if we use gets() to handle our input?\n");

        puts("Enter some data...");
        gets(buf);

        puts("We're still alive, right?");

        return 0;

}
```

<mark style="color:green;">**Be sure to compile with the following options for an easy follow along with this write up!**</mark>

```
gcc simple-bof.c -o simple-bof -g -fno-stack-protector -z execstack -no-pie
```

### Short Comings

I will need to learn more about ARM-based exploitation such as the x30, link register (this holds the return address) and relative addressing. Once I feel confident in these realms, I will be finishing this post.
