## Introduction

Welcome all, I hope you enjoy your stay!

_<mark style="color:yellow;">Knowledge should be free, accessible to all, and in one place. The security community permitted me to be able to learn all of this, this is just me giving back</mark>._

**This is the main place I will be documenting hacking, research, notes, my methodology, and experiences**. In other words, welcome to my world.

**I cover everything from:**

* <mark style="color:red;">Binary Exploitation</mark>
* <mark style="color:red;">Reverse Engineering</mark>
* <mark style="color:red;">Malware Development</mark>
* <mark style="color:red;">Pentesting/Redteaming Methodologies</mark>
* <mark style="color:red;">Theory</mark>

## Special Thanks

> _**I wanted to give a special thank you to Mr. Eltringham for always believing in me during my college experience. I could not have done it without you. I will forever keep your words of motivation and wisdom in the background with each professional decision I make going forward.**_

> "_**You must have confidence in your competence.**_"
>
> \~ Professor Russell

## Motivation

**These notes are an excellent way for me to convey my knowledge, skill set, and a good way to share what I've learned through my experiences. I believe sharing my notes is a great way to give back to others since I would not be where I am without collaboration efforts from others**.

## What am I currently working on?

_**Within the last year, I made a switch from&#x20;**<mark style="color:yellow;">**Pentesting**</mark>**&#x20;to&#x20;**<mark style="color:yellow;">**Vulnerability Research**</mark>**&#x20;and couldn't be happier!**_&#x20;

**How would I compare the two?**

> _**I went from attacking computers from the view of a satellite to attacking them from the perspective of looking under an electron microscope.**_

**A solid explanation of vulnerability research:**&#x20;

> _**"We're the weapon that no one saw coming**_ :wink:_**".**_

We analyze software and hardware components for vulnerabilities and develop Proof-of-Concept exploits for them.

### Projects

<mark style="color:yellow;">As of lately</mark>, I am strengthening my C and Python development skills to become a more competent developer. Want to keep track of my maldev progress -- check out my GitHub repo and my [Malware Development](malware-development/) page in my Gitbook!&#x20;

**Here I will be covering a bunch of binary exploitation:**
