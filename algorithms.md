# ðŸ“– Algorithms

## Motivation

For one to become 1337, all levels of knowledge must be taken into account; one must consume knowledge like a sponge within all areas of a focus and refuse to be a jack of all trades but must be willing to die trying to become a master of all.&#x20;

## Inspiration

_**"Algorithms"**_ _**\~ Panos Louridas**_&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
_**"An accessible introduction to algorithms, explaining not just what they are but how they work, with examples from a wide range of application areas."**_
{% endhint %}
