<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (6) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

As we last left off, we now have access to user, `iyates@cyberbotic.io`'s outlook account.&#x20;

## The Impact

This means that we have access to one or more internal mailboxes and obviously, this will open up many possibilities should trust or poor user security awareness training should be in place at this target business.

## What's Next

<mark style="color:yellow;">**From here, you want to look for the following opportunities**</mark>**:**

1. Search for emails that may contain sensitive information
2. Enumerate additional usernames
3. Enumerate passwords
4. Send emails to other staff on behalf of the compromised user
5. Send files/Links that we craft ourselves
6. Download documents in an inbox and backdoor it via a macro, sending it to another victim
