# Impacket Toolkit

## Introduction

* Impacket provides us with many different ways to enumerate, interact, and exploit Windows protocols and find the information we need using Python
* This tool is well maintained and has many contributors

## psexec.py

* This is <mark style="color:yellow;">one of the most useful tools</mark>
* This is a <mark style="color:yellow;">clone of the Sysinternals psexece executable</mark> but works slightly different
* <mark style="color:yellow;">The tool works by creating a remote service by uploading a randomly-named executable to the ADMIN$ share on the host</mark>
* It then registers the service via RPC
* <mark style="color:yellow;">Once established, communication occurs over a pipe, allowing for an interactive shell as SYSTEM on the victim</mark>

```
psexec.py inlanefreight.local/wley:'transporter@4'@172.16.5.125
```

## wmiexec.py

* wmiexec.py utilizes a semi-interactive shell where commands are executed through Windows Management Instrumentation or WMI
* It does not drop any files or executables on the target host and generates fewer logs than other modules
* Once connected, it will run the local admin user we connected with&#x20;
  * This is good because it is must stealthier than seeing SYSTEM executing commands

```

```

## Windapsearch.py

* This is a tool that can be used to enumerate users, groups, and computers from a Windows admin by utilizing LDAP queries

### Domain Admins

Enumerate all Domain Admins:

```
python3 windapsearch.py --dc-ip 172.16.5.5 -u forend@inlanefreight.local -p Klmcargo2 --da
```

### Privileged Users

Enumerate all privileged users:

```
python3 windapsearch.py --dc-ip 172.16.5.5 -u forend@inlanefreight.local -p Klmcargo2 -PU
```

## BloodHound.py

Similar to the <mark style="color:yellow;">BloodHound and SharpHound duo</mark>, this is an <mark style="color:yellow;">all-in-one package</mark> that <mark style="color:yellow;">allows a remote attacker with valid domain credentials to be able to enumerate the entire AD domain</mark>!

Help:

```
bloodhound-python -h
```

Collection Method "all":

```
sudo bloodhound-python -u 'forend' -p 'Klmcargo2' -ns 172.16.5.5 -d inlanefreight.local -c all
```

* After the command completes, you will see four .json files

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (5) (3) (1) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

* We need to upload these into BloodHound, but the easiest way is to zip them and just place one zip file in BloodHound

```
zip -r domain_BH_info.zip *.json
```

* This will zip up all of the .json files and we can upload this data into BloodHound!
