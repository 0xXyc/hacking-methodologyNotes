# Payload Placement

## Motivation

There are several different locations where you can embed a payload within a Portable Executable (PE) file. Depending on your choice, it will reside within a different "section" within it. Payloads can be stored within the following PE sections:

* `.data`
* `.rdata`
* `.text`
* `.rsrc`
* _**Custom**_ (this can be a custom header/section that is added to a PE to store your shellcode or payload and can be done so using a tool like [PE-Bear](https://github.com/hasherezade/pe-bear))
