# CPU Rabbit Hole

## The Central Processing Unit (CPU)

#### High level -- How does it work:

<mark style="color:orange;">FETCH</mark> -> <mark style="color:yellow;">DECODE</mark> -> <mark style="color:green;">EXECUTE</mark> Cycle

1. <mark style="color:orange;">Fetch</mark> instruction
2. <mark style="color:yellow;">Decode</mark> instruction
3. <mark style="color:green;">Executes</mark> instruction

Confused? Keep reading.&#x20;

#### Just the beginning...

<mark style="color:yellow;">Computers operate in binary -- 1's and 0's // on and off</mark>.

In order to compute binary on this domain, the CPU will use what is called a <mark style="color:yellow;">transistor</mark>.&#x20;

The transistor allows the source current to flow through it to the drain if there is current across the gate. <mark style="color:yellow;">This forms a "binary switch"</mark>. which will cut the wire off depending on a secondary input signal.

Modern CPU's utilize billions of transistors to perform calculations, but <mark style="color:yellow;">to understand them, you will only need to know the simple components that perform a handful of things known as gates</mark>.

{% embed url="https://www.howtogeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/cpu_2.png?trim=1,1&bg-color=000&pad=1,1" %}

### Logic Gates

The second that one <mark style="color:yellow;">stacks a few transistors on top of each other properly, you will form a logic gate</mark>.&#x20;

These appear complex, but they (logic gates) are rather simple: <mark style="color:green;">take two binary inputs and perform an operation on them and lastly, return an output</mark>.&#x20;

#### OR

<mark style="color:yellow;">Returns true if either of the inputs is true</mark>.&#x20;

#### AND

<mark style="color:yellow;">Checks if both inputs are true</mark>.

#### XOR (Exclusive or)

<mark style="color:yellow;">Checks if only one of the inputs are true</mark>.

#### N-Variants (NOR, NAND, and XNOR)

<mark style="color:yellow;">Inverted versions of their base gates</mark>.

### The Bus and Memory

<mark style="color:yellow;">Although our computer is able perform math at this point, it really can't do anything beyond that</mark>.

It can't remember anything and does nothing with what it is able to compute.

In order to do those things, would require a memory cell. Below is a depiction of that:

{% embed url="https://www.howtogeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/cpu_7.png?trim=1,1&bg-color=000&pad=1,1" %}
Basic memory cell utilizing lots of NAND gates for writing and AND gates for reading
{% endembed %}

#### How does this work?

<mark style="color:yellow;">You give some inputs</mark>, <mark style="color:yellow;">turn on the</mark> <mark style="color:yellow;"></mark>_<mark style="color:yellow;">**write**</mark>_ <mark style="color:yellow;"></mark><mark style="color:yellow;">bit and it will store the inputs within the memory cell</mark>.&#x20;

However, do you see an issue with just having a memory cell? <mark style="color:yellow;">We still don't have a way to read the information from it</mark>.&#x20;

This is done with an <mark style="color:yellow;">output enabler</mark>.

This is tied to another input A.K.A. the _**read**_ bit.

The enabler utilizes AND gates to achieve this. The read/write bits are known as "set and enables".

What are these called as a system? These are <mark style="color:yellow;">registers</mark>.

### Registers

{% embed url="https://www.howtogeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/cpu_8.png?trim=1,1&bg-color=000&pad=1,1" %}

Notice that each register still has a read/write bit associated with it. They are rather simple.&#x20;

#### Example: You want to copy R1's data into R2, what would you do?

<mark style="color:yellow;">You would turn on the read bit for R1 which would push the contents of R1 onto the bus</mark>.

<mark style="color:yellow;">After this, you would keep the read bit on, turn on the write bit for R2, which would in return copy the contents into R2</mark>.

### The Clock, Stepper, and Decoder

Registers are in charge of moving data around and storing information within the CPU. However, what tells them to move things around?

The clock is a truly core component of the CPU and will turn off and on at a pre-determined and set interval.

This is measured in hertz or cycles per second.

* e.g. A 5 GHz CPU can perform five billion cycles per second
* Therefore making this a very good metric as to how fast a CPU can be

{% embed url="https://www.howtogeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/cpu_10.png?trim=1,1&bg-color=000&pad=1,1" %}
The clock has three different clock states
{% endembed %}

The clock has <mark style="color:yellow;">three different states</mark>, the <mark style="color:yellow;">base clock</mark>, the <mark style="color:yellow;">enable clock</mark>, and the <mark style="color:yellow;">set clock</mark>.&#x20;

#### Base Clock

Will be on for half a cycle and off for the remaining half.

#### Enable Clock

Used to turn on registers and from the model above, you will see that they must remain turned on longer to ensure that the data is enabled.

#### Set Clock

Always needs to be on at the same time as the enable clock or else incorrect data could be written.

#### Stepper

The clock is connected to the stepper.

The stepper will count from one to the max step and then rest itself back to one once finished.

The clock is connected to AND gates for each register that the CPU can write to.

<mark style="color:yellow;">Program instructions used to be stored in RAM, however, they are now stored in the CPU's L1 cache which is directly embedded on the CPU and does not need to travel across the bus (slowing read/write/execute times) to fetch instructions</mark>.

#### How does it all come together?

The mainbus or motherboard is the primary component.

The Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU), Instructions Register, Registers, Control Section, and RAM all come together.

### Let's perform a single calculation

1. Load program data into the control section
2. The control section will then read two numbers from RAM, load the first one into the the ALU's instruction register and then load the second one on the bus
3. It then sends the ALU an instruction code telling it what to compute
4. The ALU then performs all calculations and stores the results in a different register
5. The CPU can read these registers and then continue the process

## Registers continued

Processors have their own set of special variables called registers.

Most of the instructions use these registers to read or write data.

* It is imperative to understand registers to understand instructions

### x64 CPU Registers

The x64 CPU has eight different registers. These are like internal variables for the processor.&#x20;

Please go over the reference sheet when looking through the debugger output for a better understanding of what is going on.&#x20;

{% embed url="https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs107/resources/x86-64-reference.pdf" %}

### What is GDB? -- Debuggers

Debuggers are used by programmers to step through compiled programs, examine program memory, and view processor registers.

<mark style="color:yellow;">Why are they so important and so powerful?</mark>

Similar to a microscope, a debugger allows a hacker to observe the microscopic world of machine code. However, it is far more powerful than that. A debugger allows the hacker to be able to view the execution from all angles, pause it, and change anything along the way.

How can we see these variables visually to best learn about them?

* Let's use `gdb`

```
gdb -q ./helloWorld.exe
Reading symbols from .\helloWorld.exe...
(gdb) run
Starting program: C:\Users\Xyconix\Desktop\projects\C\helloWorld.exe
[New Thread 7456.0xdf8]
Hello world!

Hello world!

Hello world!

Hello world!

Hello world!

Hello world!

Hello world!

Hello world!

Hello world!

Hello world!

[Thread 7456.0xdf8 exited with code 0]
[Inferior 1 (process 7456) exited normally]
(gdb)
```

### Breakpoints

The breakpoint will stop execution right on main so that no code will execute yet.

This will allow us to pause execution and be able to display all registers and their current states.

Let's view the state of the processor registers right before the program starts:

```
(gdb) break main
Breakpoint 1 at 0x7ff74097145d: file C:\Users\Xyconix\Desktop\projects\C\helloWorld.c, line 7.
(gdb) run
Starting program: C:\Users\Xyconix\Desktop\projects\C\helloWorld.exe
[New Thread 8688.0x514]

Thread 1 hit Breakpoint 1, main () at C:\Users\Xyconix\Desktop\projects\C\helloWorld.c:7
7           for (i=0; i < 10; i++)          // This will loop 10 times
(gdb)
```

* Notice how since there is a loop in the `main()`, you will need to use `n` to execute the next instruction
* Since there are 10 loops, <mark style="color:yellow;">you need to execute it 10 times</mark>
* We can also use `info registers` to view the state of the processor registers at that time of execution

### x64 Registers

Inside of `gdb`, run: <mark style="color:green;">`set disassembly-flavor intel`</mark> to set the <mark style="color:yellow;">disassembly to be in an intel syntax</mark>.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (10).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>x64 Registers</p></figcaption></figure>

`%rip`: Instruction Pointer

`%rsp`: Stack Pointer

`%rax`: Return Value

`%rbp`: Base Pointer

These registers are known as general-purpose registers. They are responsible for executing machine instructions. `%rip` and `%rsp` <mark style="color:yellow;">are called pointers because they store 32-bit respectively and point to that location in memory. They are VERY important to program execution and memory management.</mark>&#x20;

The <mark style="color:yellow;">Instruction Pointer</mark> points to the current instruction that the processor is reading.

The <mark style="color:yellow;">Stack Pointer</mark> is used to keep track of the top of the stack in the program's memory. It points to the most recently pushed value onto the stack.

The <mark style="color:yellow;">Base Pointer</mark> is used as a reference or base pointer in stack-based operations. It is often used to access function parameters, local variables, and saved registers within a function's stack name. The RBP usually stays the same throughout execution while the RSP changes as the stack grows and shrinks.

In short, the <mark style="color:yellow;">RSP</mark> keeps track of the top of the stack and manages stack operations.

The <mark style="color:yellow;">RBP</mark> is used as a fixed reference point within the stack frame for accessing local variables and function parameters.

I was curious about how the return value works.

On line 12 of our helloWorld.c program, I have a `return 0`, so I placed a `break 12` point on this line using \`breaklet's see what this looks like in `gdb:`

```

You can see that `%rax` has a value of `0`, hence `return 0` on line 12!!!!

How cool is that?

### Let's simplify our code...

helloWorld.c:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    puts("Hello world!\n");
    
    return 0;
}
```

```

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (7).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Utilizing x/s to look into data</p></figcaption></figure>

We can verify our **"Hello world!"** string is located within the address <mark style="color:yellow;">`0x7ff71cd04000`</mark>

What is x/s? x = examine and s = string.

We can even use `list` to view source code. This is done utlizing the `-g` option when compiling! <mark style="color:yellow;">Essentially,</mark> <mark style="color:yellow;"></mark><mark style="color:yellow;">`-g`</mark> <mark style="color:yellow;"></mark><mark style="color:yellow;">will give</mark> <mark style="color:yellow;"></mark><mark style="color:yellow;">`gdb`</mark> <mark style="color:yellow;"></mark><mark style="color:yellow;">access to the source code</mark>.

```
(gdb) list
3       int main()
4       {
5
6           //int i;
7           //for (i=0; i < 10; i++)          // This will loop 10 times
8           puts("Hello world!\n");     // puts() will write a string to stdout up to but not including the null char
9
10          return 0;
11
12      }
(gdb)
```

### Operations

Intel syntax will generally follow this style:

```
operation <destination>, <source>
```

There are operations that are used to control the flow of execution.

The `cmp` <mark style="color:yellow;">operation is used to compare values and basically any operation with j is used to jump to a different part of code</mark>.

Any operation that starts with **j** is used to **jump** to a different part of the code.

## Debugging

In the next section, we will be further debugging our simple helloWorld.c.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (2).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Let's walk through this a little bit more:

1. `set disassembly-flavor intel` will set the syntax to utilize an Intel-based syntax
2. `list` list out the source code
3. `disas main` will List out the disassembly of main()
4. `b main` establishes a breakpoint at the start of `main()`. When debugging, you will <mark style="color:yellow;">hit the breakpoint</mark> of `main()` before any execution actually begins within `main()` and <mark style="color:yellow;">any execution up to this point is paused</mark>.
5. Then, we use `info register rip` to display the value of the <mark style="color:yellow;">RIP instruction pointer</mark>.

### Examining values in memory

Shorthand commands:

`-o`: <mark style="color:yellow;">display in octal</mark>

`-x`: <mark style="color:yellow;">display in hex</mark>

`-u`: <mark style="color:yellow;">display in unsigned, base-10 decimal</mark>

`-t`: <mark style="color:yellow;">display in binary</mark>

Also, we can do the same with `info register rip` and just use `i r rip`.

Let's use shorthand to examine our RIP register in a few different ways:

Syntax: <mark style="color:yellow;">`x/<display_type> <address>`</mark>

Also, if we wanted to directly reference registers, we can use them as variables since that's all they are!

<mark style="color:yellow;">`x/x $rip`</mark>

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (12).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Valid size letters:

`-b`: <mark style="color:yellow;">single byte</mark>

`-h`: <mark style="color:yellow;">a halfword, which is two bytes in size</mark>

`-w`: <mark style="color:yellow;">a word, which is four bytes in size</mark>

`-g`: <mark style="color:yellow;">a giant, which is eight bytes in size</mark>

Note: word is two bytes in size, DWORDs are 4-byte values, don't get this confused.

### String Literals and Regular Strings

**String Literals**: <mark style="color:yellow;">A sequence of chars encloses in quotation marks within the source code of a program</mark>. Typically stored in read-only memory. Cannot be modified at runtime.&#x20;

e.g. "Hello, World!"

**Regular Strings**: <mark style="color:yellow;">Created at runtime and can be modified during execution</mark>.&#x20;

e.g.

<pre class="language-c"><code class="lang-c"><strong>#include &#x3C;stdio.h>
</strong>#include &#x3C;string.h>

int main()
{
<strong>    char str_a[20];
</strong>        strcpy(str_a, "Hello world!\nI'm now a regular string in an array!\n";
        printf(str_a);
}
</code></pre>

<mark style="color:red;">Uh oh! I bet you tried to compile this and ended up getting a warning about an overflow!</mark>

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (4).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

<mark style="color:yellow;">Since the size of this string is of 52 bytes, we need to statically size our buffer of 52 rather than 20, or we will overflow into our stack with our string. This is why you need to be careful with</mark> <mark style="color:yellow;"></mark><mark style="color:yellow;">`strcpy`</mark><mark style="color:yellow;">!</mark>

Fixed code:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main()
{
    char str_a[52];
        strcpy(str_a, "Hello world!\nI'm now a regular string in an array!\n";
        printf(str_a);
}
```

#### What if you did not know the size?

That's where you will dynamically allocate using `malloc()`.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (5).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

## Data Type Sizes

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{

    printf("The 'int' data type is \t\t %d bytes\n\n", sizeof(int));                          // int data type
    printf("The 'short int' data type is \t %d bytes\n\n", sizeof(short int));                // short int data type
    printf("The 'long int' data type is \t %d bytes \n\n", sizeof(long int));                 // long int data type
    printf("The 'long long int' data type is %d bytes\n\n", sizeof (long long int));       // long long data type
    printf("The 'float' data type is \t %d bytes\n\n", sizeof(float));                          // float data type
    printf("The 'char' data type is \t %d bytes\n\n", sizeof(char));                        // char data type

}
```

So far, <mark style="color:yellow;">it is feeling like string literals are much easier to read in disassembly than regular strings</mark>.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (6).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

## Pointers

<mark style="color:yellow;">The EIP register is a pointer that "points" to the current instruction during a program's execution by containing its memory address</mark>.

The idea of pointers is HUGE in C.&#x20;

Since physical memory cannot actually be moved, the information in it must be copied. Space for the new destination copy must be saved or allocated before the source can be copied.&#x20;

However, instead of copying a large block of memory (which would be horribly inefficient), <mark style="color:yellow;">it is much simpler to pass around the address of the beginning of that block of memory</mark>.

Pointers in C are 32 bits in size (4 bytes) and defined using an asterisk to the variable name.
