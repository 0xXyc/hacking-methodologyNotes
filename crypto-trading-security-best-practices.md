# Crypto Trading Security Best Practices

## Introduction/Motivation

<mark style="color:yellow;">**Why create this guide?**</mark>

I've always loved cryptocurrency and am a firm believer of the perks and benefits that come along with it. With that being said, and like anything else awesome in life, it comes with few different inherent risks that must be faced and accepted in order to continue operation to maximize security and success to avoid losing your assets.&#x20;

Unfortunately, this is information that should be made more public, but isn't due to lack of guides, awareness, and general ignorance to many.

<mark style="color:yellow;">**The Goals?**</mark>

**I want you to walk away from this guide more interested about your operational security (OpSec) and protecting your investments as much as possible.**

**Why Should you Care?**

**There are many reasons why you should care about your security when trading crypto.**&#x20;

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/image (237).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Illustrating Public/Private key Pairs</p></figcaption></figure>

1. **Crypto was created surrounding security professionals and as a result security is a strong focus in the crypto space. With one caveat, it must be used correctly.**
2. Why do I need to "jump through these extra hoops"? Simply put, you do not want to be a sheep with your money and your assets. This is your hard earned money and can be taken from you extremely quickly.&#x20;
3. If you choose to trade your crypto without a hardware wallet or "cold" wallet storage solution, you are at the mercy of the vendor for protecting your crypto. This is because cryptocurrency relies on asymmetric encryption. This is a huge rabbit hole and can be an entire blog post on its own. However, for brevity, just understand that in asymmetric encryption, there will **always** be a public/private key pair. This is a mutual relationship that exists with your crpytocurrency asset and both are required to gain access to your crypto as well as trade it. However, if you choose not to use a hardware, "cold" wallet solution, you do not have access to the private key and instead, the vendor (e.g. Coinbase) is placed with securing and storing your private key. <mark style="color:red;">**If this private key is ever stolen and ends up in the wrong hands, so does your crypto**</mark>. With that being said, if you take anything from this post, please invest in a crypto hardware wallet solution such as the [Nano Ledger X](https://www.amazon.com/Ledger-Nano-Cryptocurrency-Hardware-Bluetooth/dp/B07M6R4NK3), you will forever thank me later.&#x20;

**How Could This Happen?**

If (rather when) the vendor was to be involved in a severe and sophisticated cyber attack, then that means that your private keys and crypto assets are at risk. Attackers can steal these private keys and use them to steal your crypto and transfer it right out of your account.

<mark style="color:yellow;">With that being said, it is best practice to use a "cold" wallet, hardware solution to store your crypto in the most secure manner</mark>.

#### TL;DR

<mark style="color:green;">In this guide, I am offering some additional context as to why you want to consider this route but if you are in a hurry or already aware of the reasoning, be sure to skip to the</mark> <mark style="color:green;"></mark><mark style="color:green;">**Trading Solution**</mark> <mark style="color:green;"></mark><mark style="color:green;">section to jump right into the guide!</mark>&#x20;

<mark style="color:green;">Also, please invest in a "cold" wallet cryptocurrency solution such as the Nano Ledger X to secure your crypto assets.</mark> <mark style="color:green;"></mark><mark style="color:green;">**This is single-handedly the most important takeaway from this guide**</mark><mark style="color:green;">.</mark>

<mark style="color:yellow;">**In the world of cyber security, I've learned...**</mark>

**There is no such thing as a&#x20;**_**balance**_**&#x20;in terms of security over convenience in every day life.**&#x20;

<mark style="color:yellow;">**Confused? Keep reading:**</mark>&#x20;

**Too much convenience and you've compromised your security posture. Too much security and you've safeguarded yourself so much to the point that working is an extreme chore and in order to be both productive and secure simultaneously is extremely difficult. Finding a healthy median is the ultimate goal. This guide attempts to take both qualities into account to make this possible.**&#x20;

**This can be perceived as a scale.**

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/image (4) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Security/Convenience Scale Illustration</p></figcaption></figure>

### <mark style="color:yellow;">**What is the structure of this guide going to follow?**</mark>

Due to the complexity of this information and to avoid information overload, this guide is going to be split up into two different parts: **Segmentation** and **Abiding to Best Practices.**

## Segmentation

In order to protect your assets, you must consider (assume) all of your personal devices are already compromised and you need to take immediate action to avoid [**social engineering**](https://www.cmu.edu/iso/aware/dont-take-the-bait/social-engineering.html) (human hacking e.g. phishing, vishing, etc.) and other hacking attempts against you.&#x20;

In security terms, this effort is best known as the <mark style="color:red;">**assumed breach approach/mindset**</mark> (assuming that all information technology devices are already breached/compromised and best efforts must be taken into account to minimize damages).

Another way to look at **Segmentation** is by applying a **layered security approach** methodology to anything that is systems or information technology-related within your life. In a nutshell, this makes the life of an attacker much more difficult and ensures that one system is able to "pick up the slack" and still successfully maintain the integrity of your security if one security system/implementation fails or becomes compromised. &#x20;

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/image (231).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Layered Security Approach</p></figcaption></figure>

Ensuring that your assets are abiding to the layered security approach will ensure that you are able to both store your assets and trade in the most secure manner as possible.&#x20;

### <mark style="color:yellow;">**How do I get started?**</mark>

**As you continue reading this guide, you will notice that there will be a few products that I highly recommend you purchase in order to give you a significant edge in terms of security.**&#x20;

**I would immediately begin with purchasing two products that will instantly provide a security boost to your current security posture:**

1. <mark style="color:green;">**Cryptocurrency "Cold Wallet" Asset Storage Solution**</mark>: [Nano Ledger X](https://www.amazon.com/Ledger-Nano-Cryptocurrency-Hardware-Bluetooth/dp/B07M6R4NK3?crid=2HMJ8FGL8U11B\&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.m3q5go0pbnWJTR1UHvEWY110NjB0sEg1L4Q3dQ-snLtZt70Wyr44sTtHVhiARCSjMP3xXUxZqBm76Tk_Db3PGBa58AIDyU7jbxdQzZMx1pL3RsQe9GgGMvVucU97zXiTIuNPl6zDcsESE6kYAY9wdfb7AjhLEFRJbyBbX5WVbt8sOb2CExgPvAtRcSe4F3DDlAEc3nYAdM_8opLm7vw_y1KzfTNjkVbfa_zisbowhIo.aE6UsS8rvl6t2lLHQMMZpM7_qK0X2nc5MwDceYzSAts\&dib_tag=se\&keywords=nano+ledger+zero\&qid=1735824223\&sprefix=nano+ledger+zero%2Caps%2C126\&sr=8-4)
2. <mark style="color:green;">**Faraday Bag**</mark>**:** [**SLNT**](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07CRNSZ3G?_encoding=UTF8\&th=1)&#x20;

**Not familiar with these products? Don't worry, I'll be giving a brief description of them and why they are so important and should be added to your everyday carry (EDC).**

### Why the "Cold Wallet" Storage Solution?

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/image (233).png" alt=""><figcaption><p><em>Nano Ledger X Cold Wallet Cryptocurrency Storage Solution</em></p></figcaption></figure>

Rather than putting your trust in vendors to store your crypto, having access to a "cold" wallet storage solution places the security and convenience of the entire chain/relationship of the cryptographic key pair right in your pocket.&#x20;

### Pro's and Con's

However, this doesn't come to mention without some pro's and con's, of course.

#### Pro's

The pro's are that if you buy cryptocurrency from a specific vendor and they were to be hacked, you will not lose your cryptocurrency as long as you have taken the necessary steps to transfer your crypto assets off of the vendor's platform and into the wallet address of the "cold" storage solution. Your "cold" wallet is secured with a PIN code as well if you were to lose it or leave it behind at the coffee shop.

#### Con's

Going about this method places the entire cryptographic key pair within your ownership. If you lose your private key/seed phrase, you will lose all of your crypto. That is why it is best practice to physically write down your cryptographic seed phrase (usually 12-24 words long) and store multiple copies in multiple locations so that way you can always have access to your crypto assets, even if you lose your PIN.

#### Okay, I'm almost convinced, but what happens if I lose the "cold" wallet???

Rest assured, developers for this technology have thought about this. All you need to do in order to gain access back to your crypto assets are to obtain your seed phrase (talked about above) and buy a new "cold" wallet device (obviously) and input it on the software that comes with your device.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
💡 The same applies if you forget your PIN to access the "cold" wallet.
{% endhint %}

### Why the Faraday Bag (SLNT Bag)? Is it Necessary?

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/image (234).png" alt=""><figcaption><p><em><strong>SLNT Faraday Bag</strong></em></p></figcaption></figure>

Your "cold" wallet utilizes Near-Field Communication (NFC — this enables technologies such as Apple Pay or Airdrop) and Bluetooth (BLE) technology. This means that it can be intercepted and manipulated by a remote attacker with unknown capabilities. The Faraday bag is responsible for blocking all Radio Frequency Identifying technologies (RFID).

The SLNT faraday bag is an electro-magnetic pulse, EMP-resistent bag that blocks all radio frequency (RF) signals. This includes (but is not limited to) cell phone signals, Bluetooth, NFC, and more radio signals.

Attackers sit within coffee shops, airports, public transportation, and many other public locations in an attempt to snoop within the airwaves without you even noticing and are able to harvest sensitive and important data off of your devices.

{% hint style="info" %}
💳💰 Yes, this includes your credit/debit cards as well. They have NFC chips on them for Tap-to-Pay features. This is why some companies have started manufacturing RFID-blocking wallets.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

This is possible because all of these devices utilize these technologies.

## Just how Serious and Prevalent are Crypto Heists?&#x20;

Make the $150 investment on the "cold" wallet solution, please.&#x20;

## Best Practices: Trading Solution

<mark style="color:green;">The convenience of being able to trade on your phone is great, but being able to trade on your laptop is just as convenient and it offers enhanced security solutions such as virtual machines (VM's).</mark>&#x20;

<mark style="color:yellow;">This is essentially a segmented, more secure environment for you to conduct your daily activities in. Whether you are on a Mac or a Windows laptop or PC, you will be able to utilize this technology following these techniques.</mark>&#x20;

### Setting up our new Virtual Environment

1. Download VMware Fusion if you are on a Mac or [WMware Workstation Pro 17](https://blogs.vmware.com/workstation/2024/05/vmware-workstation-pro-now-available-free-for-personal-use.html) in order to obtain virtualization software to create your VM
   1. 💡It is going to ask you to create a Broadcom account, go ahead and fill this with alias and fake information
2. Now that you have virtualization software, you will now need an operating system (OS) that is able to virtualize an entire OS within your host computer's virtual address space (memory, or Random Access Memory (RAM) within your computer)
   1. For this use case, I recommend the usage of Ubuntu
   2. Ubuntu is an open-source, Linux-based distribution/OS that is easy to learn and can be quickly spun up on virtually any computer/architecture&#x20;
   3. You can grab your copy [here](https://releases.ubuntu.com/22.04/ubuntu-22.04.5-desktop-amd64.iso) for x86/64 processors (<mark style="color:yellow;">most of you will download this one</mark>) or [here](https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description\&redir_token=QUFFLUhqbWVhLURlbmFCcmhTSEtTRDFNM25nd1Yyb3FqQXxBQ3Jtc0trdVMxVi15NFNsMnoxSVh2b09TRDNoRXppSm5Da1Z4aGU4dFVvc3JlVlBYeGxVa2h0cXlLMUxXenAxckFyRUFpeHpRdjlrWVNvcl90UU5sc0ZXemthVkN1LXBPc1M5Wm1nY3NCNUo3SFV5NEhXbFYxNA\&q=https%3A%2F%2Fcdimage.ubuntu.com%2Fjammy%2Fdaily-live%2Fcurrent%2F\&v=b8W2-zjzOK0) if you are on an ARM-based Mac (Apple Silicon — newer Macs)

Once you have installed the following software, I then want you to begin be installing the VMware software first. Once opened, you will then navigate to the **New** tab and from there, you will be able to navigate through your **Downloads** folder to find your Ubuntu image that you have downloaded.

> &#x20;_<mark style="color:yellow;">**🚨 Be sure to adjust your CPU and memory count to above the default values. For most, the sweet spot will be around 4 CPU's and 8GB of memory. This is crucial to having a stable, reliable, and speedy virtualized system. Also, for this purpose, 50GB of storage space is plenty for this type of application for the VM.**</mark>_

**Once you are past this part, you will then install the Ubuntu OS like you would on a normal computer. It will appear that you are deleting everything within your storage space and this is true to a degree, this only applies to your 50 GB of allocated space within the virtual address space you assigned to the virtual disk upon creation of the VM. Not to your host OS (Mac or Windows).**&#x20;

> <mark style="color:yellow;">**🤔 If you are confused at this part, please reach out to me and I will gladly help you with this step. You will only need to do this once after it is successfully installed and configured.**</mark>

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/image (232).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Illustration of installing Telegram easily on Ubuntu</p></figcaption></figure>

Now that we have Telegram installed, we can launch it by pressing the applications button on the bottom-left of the screen in Ubuntu and we can search for "Telegram".&#x20;

Next, we can follow the on-screen instructions that will allow us scan a QR code with our cell phone that will allow the same session as our cell phone's to be authenticated to our newly created desktop client. Message syncing and contacts will be synced from device-to-device.&#x20;

> <mark style="color:green;">💡 Here, we can trade crypto utilizing well-vetted trading bots and sync our wallets accordingly using best practices in a safe and sterile environment that is virtually segmented from your other data and assets.</mark> &#x20;

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/image (235).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Example image</p></figcaption></figure>

The above is showcasing the usage of an Ethereum trading bot known as Starbot. With this, I can create a wallet address and transfer stored crypto from my cold wallet storage device such as the Nano Ledger X to our volatile trading account (wallet) for bot usage.&#x20;

> <mark style="color:red;">**‼️ Pro tip:**</mark> The Nano Ledger X cold wallet storage device should be treated like a savings account and should essentially never be touched. Whereas your bot trading account/wallet should never store excessive amounts of crypto for security reasons as you do not have control of the entire key pair (private and public keys). The bot developers will always have access to your private keys likely even if they say that they do not.
