# ü§æ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Return/Jump-Oriented Programming -- ROP vs. JOP

## Introduction

ROP/JOP is a technique that enables attackers to bypass exploit mitigations. Such as the No-eXecute (NX) bit.&#x20;

ROP/JOP gadgets are short sequences of machine instructions (machine code) that end in return or branch instructions.&#x20;

We can obtain gadgets from either the binary (program) itself, or from the dynamically-loaded library, such as `libc.so`.

Various gadgets will either end in a `ret` (return) or a `blr` ( branch & link register) instruction.&#x20;

Gadgets ending with `ret` instructions will be ROP gadgets.&#x20;

Gadgets ending in `blr` instructions will be JOP gadgets.&#x20;

### Why?

Why you might ask... well, gadgets can be "chained" together in order to leverage already existent code within the binary.&#x20;

They are essentially a "program within a program".

### Examples

**Be sure to check out my older blog on ROP chains.**

**Note: We can use a ROP chain to fulfill register values to obtain reverse shells or some other cyber effect on your target.**

## Obtaining Gadgets

We can utilize `gdb` to manually obtain ROP/JOP gadgets.

We can also utilize a tool known as [`ropper`](https://github.com/sashs/Ropper).&#x20;



### GDB

We can utilize `gdb` to dump memory and scan for ROP gadgets!

Load up your program in `gdb`.

Perform the following:

```
set logging enabled on

info sharedlibrary libc.so    # Copy libc base address (top-left)

x/30000i <library_base_address>     # Paste libc base address

q

more gdb.txt | grep ldp
```

Essentially, this is an alternative for `ropper`!

### Utilizing Ropper

```
ropper --help-examples

ropper -f </path/to/libc.so> --search "ldp x0"

# Search for "pop x0" for system(x0 (first parameter) -> ("/bin/sh"))
```
