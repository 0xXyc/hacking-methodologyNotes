# üçé MacOS Security Research

## Introduction and Motivations

I have a few short/long-term goals and ideas that I want to do and I strongly believe that spending more time better equipping myself with Mac/iOS security research will make my security adventure all the more enjoyable and fruitful (pun intended).

{% hint style="info" %}
<mark style="color:red;">**Disclaimer**</mark>**:** For OpSec purposes as well as considerations for protecting my personal, intellectual ideas, I am unable to share all of the details for my future idea at this time. So, the motivations may not entirely be clear, this is my upfront apology for the brevity.&#x20;

If you have any questions or curiosities, please feel free to reach out to me. However, this won't inhibit this page's ability to still be unbelievable.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

### Threat Actors are Scary and Dangerous...

**This is true, it goes back all the way to the early days of hacking:**

> _**"With enough motivation, time, and effort put into researching your target, this will make anything insecure, and allow an attacker a way in."**_
>
> _**Remember:** <mark style="color:red;">nothing</mark> is <mark style="color:green;">secure</mark>._

I truly want to lead my own independent research on the targets and platforms that I am most passionate about. Being an avid and constant user of Apple products, in addition to being a security professional already makes me want to learn more and more about these devices. What makes them tick, how is something implemented, asking the why's, the how's, and understanding the bigger picture for the reasons and motivations behind some of Apple's biggest design decisions.&#x20;

Truly, I am most excited about learning about exploit mitigation technologies such as Pointer Authentication Codes (PAC) and so many more. These always amazed me!

## Apple's Bug Bounty Program

These prices are insane for finding bugs within Apple's ecosystem. This needs to be considered and looked at.&#x20;

**Keep in mind: these are all priced this way for a reason. Do you really think it's that easy?**

No, this is going to require serious dedication and effort. <mark style="color:yellow;">But, I believe in myself. Do you?</mark>

### What Will This Page be About?

I will dedicate this space for determining if I believe that this is a route for me. Based off of my ideas alone, I **strongly** believe that this will be an incredibly difficult, humbling, journey. But, also may be my most "worth it" adventure yet. This will also greatly be centered around the Off Sec certification, the Off Sec MacOS Researcher (OSMR).

### OffSec MacOS Researcher

{% embed url="https://www.offsec.com/courses/exp-312/" %}

Not going to lie, this is so niche, that it really caught my eye. I really want this.

### This page will consist of the following

* Problems that I may run into
* General research to get my "head in the game"&#x20;
* Critical prerequisites
* Problems and potential shortcomings with the course itself
* and so much more

**With that out of the way... let's dive into this rabbit hole!**
