# ‚è™ Reversing Engineering

**Go from zero-to-strong intermediate reverse engineer!**

This will cover <mark style="color:yellow;">x86, x64, and 32-bit/64-bit ARM architectures!</mark>

Time to get after it!!!

## Building/Installing Ghidra on Mac w/ Apple Silicon (M1-M3)

I highly recommend using VM's for any/all reversing efforts, see below this section, or continue if you aren't hyper paranoid like me.

**Clone repo:**

```
git clone 
```

Now, `cd` into the `ghidra` master directory.

Use brew to install Gradle:

```
brew install gradle
```

**Install dependencies w/ Gradle:**

```
gradle -I gradle/support/fetchDependencies.gradle init
```

Build w/ Gradle:

```
gradle buildGhidra
```

**Obtain build:**

```
cd build/dist
unzip ghidra_11.1_DEV_20240420_mac_arm_64.zip # unzip 
```

**Run Ghidra:**

```
./ghidraRun
```

## Building/Installing Ghidra on Ubuntu AARM64 (MAC w/ Apple Silicon)

This absolutely sucked and took hours to debug... I used multiple Gradle versions and the only one that seemed to work for me was <mark style="color:yellow;">Gradle-7.6.2 (you'll likely need 8.5+ in 2025 now)</mark>.

We do this because we want to be smart and segment our device from threats as much as possible, right?

**Install openjdk-21-jdk (Dependency):**

```
sudo apt install openjdk-21-jdk
```

**Download and install Gradle from the SDKMAN package manager, but first install SDK:**

```
 curl -s "https://get.sdkman.io" | bash 
```

**Install Gradle via SDK:**

```
sdk install gradle 8.5 # Minimum standard according to Ghidra docs
```

**Update PATH:**

```
readlink -f $(which java)
/usr/lib/jvm/java-21-openjdk-arm64/bin/java

export JAVA_HOME="/usr/lib/jvm/java-21-openjdk-arm64" #Be sure to remove /bin/java at the end
```

**Clone Ghidra:**

```
git clone https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/ghidra.git
cd ghidra
```

**Build dependencies:**

```
gradle -I gradle/support/fetchDependencies.gradle init 
```

**Build Ghidra:**

> :rotating\_light: <mark style="color:yellow;">**If this doesn't work, Ghidra may be at a different version.**</mark>

```
gradle buildGhidra
cd build/dist
ghidra_11.4_DEV_20250511_linux_arm_64.zip
cd ghidra_11.4_DEV
```

**Run Ghidra:**

```
./ghidraRun
```

Add `ghidraRun` as an alias, update source and BOOM, done.
